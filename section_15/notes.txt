Section 14 - NoSQL, semi-structured data


NoSQL
- not SQL
- flexible schema
- variable number of property
- Data model will be like
    - document
    - key-value pair
    - graph-based

    something like: 
    {
        'id': 100,
        'fn': 'Freanu',
        'ln': 'Peria'
    },
    {
        'id': 101,
        'fn': 'Lex',
        'ln': 'Luthor',
        'money': 99999999
    }

    - you can think of JSON


Gemini Says:
No, JSON itself is not a NoSQL database; rather, it is a data format that
is commonly used by NoSQL databases (also includes key-value pairs and documents). 

NoSQL is a broad category of non-relational databases, 
and JSON databases are a specific type of NoSQL database designed 
to store and query data in JSON format.

Section 15 - DataStore & FireStore

DataStore

- serverless and highly scalable NoSQL Database
- tight coupling with App Engine (+ DataStore)
- can use SQL-like query (GQL)
- ACID Transaction
- data replication across different region


*- on the demo, we can see that gcp somewhat mixes Datastore and Firestore.
    - author also says that if you already picked datastore for your Google App Engine,
        Datastore will be default for your project and you wont be able to use Firestore

*- differences: read more at https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore

Firestore

- next generation of Datastore
- collection & document model
- modes:
    - native mode
    - datastore mode

*- ChatGPT says...

ðŸ”¹ Google Cloud Datastore (legacy)

NoSQL document database originally offered by Google App Engine.
Stored data as entities with keyâ€“value properties.
Strong consistency only for some operations (others were eventually consistent).
Limited querying and indexing compared to newer databases.
Now deprecated â€” automatically upgraded to Firestore in Datastore mode.

ðŸ”¹ Google Cloud Firestore

The successor to Datastore (NoSQL document DB).
Two modes:
Native mode â†’ for mobile/web apps (tight integration with Firebase SDK).
Datastore mode â†’ backward-compatible for apps built on Cloud Datastore.
Stores data as documents inside collections (more flexible than Datastore entities).
Stronger ACID transactions across multiple documents and collections.
Real-time sync for apps (if using Native mode).
Richer querying, indexing, and scalability compared to Datastore.

âœ… In short:

Datastore = legacy document DB.
Firestore = the new generation (better queries, transactions, scalability, and Firebase integration).
If youâ€™re starting fresh â†’ always use Firestore (Native mode) unless you specifically need Datastore compatibility.
