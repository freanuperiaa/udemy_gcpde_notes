Section 17 - Cloud BigQuery

- Database Warehouse Solution
- Columnar Storage
- for Analytical Database


BigQuery Data Organization

project -> dataset -> table

you can assign role at the organization, project, or dataset level


BigQuery also jobs (some which we are discussing here in Section 19 for the Data Processing part of the course)
- Load
- Query (we usually do this at work)
- Extract
- Copy


When to use BigQuery?
- when workload is analytical
- when Data doesn't change in database, as bigquery uses built-in cache
- for complex queries
- when query takes more execution time
- off-load some workload from primary transaction DB
- when your data is denormalized


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! TIL moment(s)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- when you run a query, you can see more info in "Job Information" tab
    - in it, you can see a destination table which stores the query results (if applicable)
      and it has a 24h validity (gets deleted) - so you can use it when doing investigation!!!
      no need to rerun complex queries, just go and see the result in the temp table
