what does it mean when a database is columnar like bigquery and aws redshift
Of course! This is a fantastic question that gets to the heart of why modern data warehouses are so powerful.

In simple terms, a columnar database stores data by columns, while a traditional row-based database stores data by rows.

Let's break this down with an analogy.

The Bookstore Analogy
Imagine you are looking for specific information in a library.

Row-Based Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): This is like a library where each book (a row) is a complete story about a customer. To find "all customers who live in New York," you have to pick up every single customer's book, open it, skip to the "City" chapter, check the city, and then put the book down. You're reading entire books just to find one piece of information from each.

Columnar Database (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift): This library is organized differently. Instead of books, they have massive scrolls for each type of information. There's a giant "Customer Name" scroll, an "Email" scroll, an "Age" scroll, and a "City" scroll, all aligned. To find "all customers who live in New York," you simply go to the "City" scroll and read it from top to bottom. You can very quickly find all the positions where "New York" appears without ever touching the "Name," "Email," or "Age" scrolls.

Technical Deep Dive: How it Actually Works
Row-Based Storage (OLTP - Online Transaction Processing)
Data is stored sequentially row by row.

text
Row 1: [UserID: 101, Name: Alice, City: London, SignupDate: 2023-01-15]
Row 2: [UserID: 102, Name: Bob, City: New York, SignupDate: 2023-01-16]
Row 3: [UserID: 103, Name: Charlie, City: London, SignupDate: 2023-01-17]
On Disk: 101, Alice, London, 2023-01-15, 102, Bob, New York, 2023-01-16, 103, Charlie, London, 2023-01-17

Columnar Storage (OLAP - Online Analytical Processing)
Data is stored by columns.

text
Column 1 (UserID):  [101, 102, 103]
Column 2 (Name):    [Alice, Bob, Charlie]
Column 3 (City):    [London, New York, London]
Column 4 (SignupDate): [2023-01-15, 2023-01-16, 2023-01-17]
On Disk: 101, 102, 103, Alice, Bob, Charlie, London, New York, London, 2023-01-15, 2023-01-16, 2023-01-17

Why Columnar Storage is a Game-Changer for Analytics (BigQuery, Redshift)
This fundamental difference in storage leads to massive advantages for querying large datasets:

Dramatically Faster Aggregation and Analytics Queries

A query like SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE city = 'London' only needs to read the City column. It doesn't touch the Name, Email, or other irrelevant columns. This is called column pruning.

Reading only the necessary data means reading less data from disk, which is often the main bottleneck. Less I/O = faster queries.

Better Compression

Data within a single column is usually of the same type and has repeating values (e.g., many "London" entries in the City column, or numbers close to each other in a Price column).

This homogeneity allows for highly effective compression techniques like run-length encoding (e.g., "London, 500 times") or dictionary encoding. This further reduces the amount of data read from disk.

Efficient Vectorized Processing

Modern CPUs can process a batch of values (a vector) in a single operation. Columnar storage is perfectly suited for this because it can load a chunk of a single column (e.g., 1000 integers) directly into the CPU cache and operate on them all at once, rather than jumping around to different data types in a row.

The Trade-Offs: When Columnar is Not Ideal
No solution is perfect for everything. Columnar databases have significant weaknesses:

Poor Performance for OLTP Workloads

An operation like inserting a new customer (INSERT INTO customers ...) or updating a single customer's record is very inefficient. The database would have to open and update every single column file to write that one new row, which is incredibly slow compared to a row-based database that just appends one new row to the end of a file.

Not Ideal for SELECT * Queries

If you need to retrieve all data for a single row or a small set of rows, a columnar database has to perform a lot of work to reassemble the row from all its separate column files. A row-based database can fetch the entire row in one go.

BigQuery and Redshift: Nuances
While both are columnar, they have different architectures:

Google BigQuery: A fully managed, serverless system. You don't manage servers or clusters. It automatically scales compute and storage independently. You pay for the amount of data processed by your queries.

AWS Redshift: A managed, cluster-based system. You provision a cluster of nodes (leader and compute nodes). You need to think about capacity, scaling, and maintenance (though it's greatly simplified). You pay for the cluster's uptime.

Summary Table
Feature	Row-Based Database (e.g., MySQL)	Columnar Database (e.g., BigQuery, Redshift)
Storage Method	Stores data by rows	Stores data by columns
Ideal For	OLTP: High-volume transactions, INSERTs/UPDATEs, retrieving few full rows.	OLAP: Complex analytics, aggregations (SUM, COUNT), scanning large volumes of data.
Query Speed	Fast for transactions and point queries.	Very fast for analytical queries that touch few columns.
Data Compression	Less efficient	Highly efficient
Weakness	Slow for large-scale aggregations.	Slow for transactional writes and SELECT * on few rows.
