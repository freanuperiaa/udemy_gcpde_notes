Section 20 - Google Cloud PubSub


* Gemini answered *
Yes, Google Cloud Pub/Sub is often compared to Apache Kafka because both are distributed messaging systems for
asynchronous communication, but Pub/Sub is a fully managed, serverless publish/subscribe service within the
Google Cloud ecosystem. Kafka is a distributed streaming log with a partition-centric model requiring more user
management, while Pub/Sub offers dynamic sharding and automatic replication for resilience, making it more
suitable for a managed cloud environment. 

PubSub - fully-managed asynchronous messaging service

publisher - app sends message to topic

push & pull way to access messages
pull - subscriber pulls messages
push - publisher pushes message / message sent to subscriber via webhook


one topic can have multiple subscriber
one subscriber can have multiple topic


** yeah just like the pubsub you have learned on other tuts **
** but this one, we created them on gcp, manually published a message into topic and pulled it from a subscription **


Delivery Types:
    - Push
    - Write to Cloud Storage
    - Write to BigQuery


so upon doing hands-on, looks like retrieving of messages are only allowed with
subscriptions which have delivery type = pull
    - whatever is published, it gets pushed directly by the subscription to the endpoint specified



Dead Lettering in GCP Pub/Sub
    - A mechanism for handling messages that cannot be successfully processed by subscribers
    - When a subscriber repeatedly fails to acknowledge a message (after maximum delivery attempts), 
    the subscription automatically moves the message to a dedicated dead letter topic
    - This prevents problematic messages from blocking the main subscription and allows for separate analysis of failed messages


** PubSub Lite **

- Partition-based messaging service
- Not Global, only zonal or regional
- 


on GCP Console, it says:
Pub/Sub Lite is being deprecated. Effective March 18, 2026, Pub/Sub Lite will be turned down. If you have not used Pub/Sub Lite within 90 days preceding July 15, 2025, your access will be removed on July 15, 2025. You can migrate your Pub/Sub Lite service to Managed Service for Apache Kafka  or Pub/Sub  . Please email pubsub-lite-help@google.com if you have any questions.
