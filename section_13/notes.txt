Section 12 - Google Cloud Spanner


- distributed and scalable RDBMS solution in GCP
- unlike Google Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner *can go wide/horizontal*
- used for mission-critical applications
- costlier than Cloud SQL, only recommended when Data Volume > 2 TB

- Cloud Spanner has horizontal read/write replicas across region
    - Cloud SQL has only horizontal read replicas



*- in the hands on demo, when we created a table, we specified to link
    it to another table by the `INTERLEAVE IN PARENT` table which 
    instructs Spanner to couple these tables together in a zone so that
    retrieving data is easier

    *- Interleaved tables in Spanner are child tables whose rows are physically stored
       with their associated parent row, optimizing performance for common parent-child 
       relationships. This physical co-location significantly speeds up queries and joins
       involving the parent and child tables because the data resides on the same storage nodes, 
       reducing network overhead and simplifying data retrieval. 




Which database to use When

- Cloud SQL
    - good for lift & shift (quick migrate) based system
    - bestfor CRM, ecommerce app
    - max data size is 30 TB

- Cloud Spanner
    - horizontal scalability
    - low latency
    - high scalability and replication
