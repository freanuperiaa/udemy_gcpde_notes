Google Block Storage


Block Storage - hard disk storage
could either be direct attached (physical) or network attached

Direct Attached - Local SSD
    - physically attached to VM
    - very high performance
    - cannot reattach to other VM
    - Lower availability
    - temporary/ephemeral storage
    - no snapshot

Network attached storage
    - persistent disk
    - zonal, regional
    - can be reattached
    - with snapshot

Google FileStore

- Network Attached Storage (NAS) for compute engine and GKE
- minimum 1TB
- costly compared to GCS

AI Overview
Cloud Storage in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - GeeksforGeeks
GCP Filestore is a high-performance, managed file system for shared access by multiple applications and
 virtual machines simultaneously, using a familiar file-based access model like NFS. 
In contrast, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is an object store designed for massive, unstructured data
like images, videos, and archives, offering high scalability but not supporting direct file system
operations or shared file access in the same way
