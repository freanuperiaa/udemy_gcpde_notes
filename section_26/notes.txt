Section 26 - Data Loss Prevention API

- managed service to help discover, classify, and protect sensitive data
- PII data - personally identifiable information
- can be applied on Cloud Storage and BigQuery
- will work on free form text, structured, and unstructured data

what DLP does with data:
- identify sensitive data and deidentify (mask, encrypt, etc)
- re-identify (in case we need the data back)


Deidentification of data:
    - redaction - remove sensitive data
    - replacement - replace with some tokens (like info_type)
    - masking - replace one/more character with some other character    
        - myemail@gmail.lcom -> my****l@*****.com
    - encrypt - scrambling data into an unreadable format
