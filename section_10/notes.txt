    - Cloud SQL
    - Cloud Spanner

Vertical - Horizontal Scaling
    - vertical - go tall, set higher resources (RAM, vCPU, etc)
    - horizontal - go wide, more VMs


RTO & RPO
    - disaster recovery (DR) terms
    - Recovery Time Objective & Recovery Point Objective
    - RPO - from what point we go back to when we recover data (based on video)
          - maximum time for which an organization can tolerate data loss

    - RTO - how long it takes for our system to go back (based on video)
          - maximum time for which our system can be down


Availability & Durability
    - Durability: how healthy and resilient your data is
    - Availability: how much amount of time data is up/available to access
